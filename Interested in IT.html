												<h3>My interested in IT</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Being able to create software that can help people to meet their demands is what I am interested in IT. In my opinion, the feeling of supporting someone by the app that I am building would be the best feeling. Moreover, I also love programming even though I just have started it recently. My interest in IT started when I saw my uncle coding. He is a game developer and seeing how he built his own game was really cool. He is the one that inspires me to choose this major.</p>

Besides, I believe RMIT  has suitable facilities and excellent teachers to serve for my IT career.</p>
