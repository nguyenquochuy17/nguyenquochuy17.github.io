												<h3>Overview and Motivation</h3>
											</header>
											<p>As we all know, health always plays an important role in life and is one of our top priorities that needs to be protected. However, because of the hustle and bustle of modern city, people are gradually neglecting their health. As a consequence, this leads to an increasing in the number of people getting illnesses or even death’s cases. To be specific,  there are 80% percent of deaths from diseases in Vietnam caused by lifestyle. As a result, my project idea is about healthcare applications that assist users in taking good care of themselves, including both their physical and mental health. To illustrate, if you want to lose, gain or maintain your weight, this app will measure the amount of calories you should eat for a day depending on your needs. Moreover, this also teaches you how to build your body perfectly by numerous lessons covered by professional trainers. Regarding to mental health, this application supports buyers to reduce their stress levels by educating them how to meditate in the right way. Moreover,  another feature of this app for staying mentally healthy is to control users’ sleep in order to keep them in the best condition. The reason why I choose this as my very first project idea is because this applications combinate many features to improve your health whereas most of the other app just focus on only one specific section. In addition, healthcare app would be easier to get customers attraction because of their priorities.</p>

												<h3>Description</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This app runs on both Android and IOS and it is free so it just only requires buyers to turn on their internet connection to download. The profit would depend on the number of downloads.</p>
											<p> Firstly, one of the most remarkable features of this application is that it is able to calculate the amount of calories that users should consume for a day depending on users’ goal. To be specific, this app would require users to provide information by asking some questions,including their name, weight, height, body measurement and the objective that users set. For example, if your desire to lose weight , the app will requires you to answer how much weight you want to lose and how many days to receive your goals. After that, this app will automatically show you the daily calories you should consume and recommend how many minutes of exercises for a day to achieve that desire. Moreover, if you do not know how many calories your meal is , this application also support you to solve this problem. Users just simply need to add what they have eaten and the app will measure the calories of that meal for them . With this feature, it would be easier to control their calories consumption to fit the amount of daily required calories.</p>
											<p>Furthermore, another feature of this application for physical health is that it assists buyers in doing exercises by various number of lessons that are taught by professional trainers. To illustrate, based on all the mentioned information that users have provided in the first place, the app will suggest suitable exercise lessons to build their body perfectly. However, if customers do not want to follow these recommended lessons, they can build their body on their own wish by typing particularly which part of the body they want to build, the app will recommend you lessons for developing that part of body.</p>

											<p>Beside these physical health support, this app could also help customers to keep their mental stable. Specifically, meditation tutorials is one of the most special features of this app. This section contains numerous different type of lessons including mindfulness, spiritual, focused, movement, mantra and transcendental meditation. Moreover, for those who already knew how to meditate, this app could support them by providing a timer with various ambient sounds and bells. Furthermore, there is also an community section that users can put their questions on and discuss with others.</p>
											<p>The last features of this app is that it could wake users up in their best condition which makes them feel not tired and energetic. Specifically, according to sleep cycle study, people will go through 3 stages during their sleeps, including light sleep, deep sleep and REM sleep (Rapid eye movement sleep). The best time to wake up is being in light sleep stage, which could make you feel restful and energetic. This app uses accelerometer which could analyze your sleep by monitoring your movement as you sleep. By accelerometer, being woken up in light sleep stage is not a big challenge.</p>

												<h3>Tools and techonology</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Software: Because this apps runs both on Android and IOS, Java, C# and Swift programming languages are mandatory to be known.</p>
											<p>Hardware: Because this app is software so it does not need any hardwares. However, having high Ram and CPU would be recommended to run this app smoothly.</p>
											<p>Equipment: To use this app, users need to have smartphones, laptops or PC. Moreover, this also connected to your Apple Watch so that it would be convenient for buyers.</p>

												<h3>Skills Required</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Having a insight knowledge of both physical and mental health is a must to create this app. In term of physical health,  knowing well about nutritions and body-building is very necessary. Moreover, health professional trainers also should be hired to cover the workout video tutorials. Regarding mental health, professional mediator should also be hired as well. However, as all things that have mentioned, it would be pretty infeasible because of the huge money to hire health experts.</p>

												<h3>Outcome</h3>
											</header>
											<p>If this project is successful, money would be the first thing that I am think of when people install and download my app. Moreover, I also believe that the original problem would be solved. People would take a good care of themself and be more healthier and nutritious. Furthermore, there would be a decline in the number of people getting illnesses and death. Personally, I think this app would cause a positive impact on human’s health. </p>
