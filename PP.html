												<h3> Result 1</h3>
											</header>
											<p>My learning style: Auditory learner</p>
											<p>This result helps me to realize my suitable learning style which is auditory. Due to this awareness, I believe that I am able to improve quickly during my study. As a result, I would consider changing my learning habit to be more effective. To be specific, instead of learning by reading books, I would switch to focus on listening. Moreover, participating in class discussions or study groups would be a good idea to advance my learning.</p>

											<p>My personality : Turbulent Adventurers
											<p>-By doing this test, I knew that I was mostly an introvert which also means I hate social interaction and prefer to be alone.</p>
											<p>-Moreover, the test shows that I am the type of person who make decision based mostly on my feeling and not confident with my decision</p>
											<p>-Furthermore, it presents that I also quite good at noticing and focus on what is going on and what has already happened.</p>

												<h3>Result 3</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The test shows that I am quite patient and focus on doing one thing at the time, based on my persistence. Moreover, I also quite creative and able to make connections between things. In contrast, my boldness is not high which means that I am not good at making decision and fears of what others think of me .</p>

										<h2>In conclusion</h2>
									</header>
									<p>- As all the results the test have shown me, I believe that my behavior would affect the team a lot. Specifically, I think these tests are true when saying that I am an introvert who is not good at making decisions and afraid of what others think. Because of that, it is difficult for me to contribute to the team and succeed in my career. In contrast , my best learning style is auditory so working on the team is very necessary to improve myself. As a consequence, I would try my best to fix my weaknesses </p>
									<p>- Since I was not really good at leading-stuff, forming with partners who could manage and make decisions well would be a good way to create a great team.</p>
